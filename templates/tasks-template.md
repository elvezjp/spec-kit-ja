- Confirm execution flow is clear and logical.

## Dependencies
- List all required libraries and tools.
- Specify version constraints if applicable.

## Execution Flow (main)
- Outline the main steps for executing the tasks.
- Ensure clarity in the order of operations.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- Define naming conventions for consistency.

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- Detail the setup process required before task execution.
- Include environment configuration steps.

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

- Outline the testing framework and methodologies to be used.

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- Describe the implementation process.
- Ensure that this phase only begins after tests have been established and are failing.

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- Explain how to integrate the implemented tasks.
- Include steps for merging and testing combined functionality.

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- Highlight the importance of refining the code and documentation.
