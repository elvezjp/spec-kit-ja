# Commands and Tasks Reference for Orchestration Library

## Overview
This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the commands and tasks available in the orchestration library. It provides users with the necessary information to effectively utilize the library's features for managing orchestration tasks.

## Command Structure
Commands in the orchestration library follow a consistent structure to ensure ease of use. The general format is:

```
orchestration <command> [options]
```

Where `<command>` is the specific action you want to perform, and `[options]` are any additional parameters that modify the command's behavior.

## Common Commands

### Start
The `start` command initiates a new orchestration process.

**Usage:**
```bash
orchestration start --name myOrchestration
```

### Stop
The `stop` command halts an ongoing orchestration process.

**Usage:**
```bash
orchestration stop --id 12345
```

### Status
The `status` command retrieves the current status of a specified orchestration process.

**Usage:**
```bash
orchestration status --id 12345
```

## Task Management

### Add Task
The `add-task` command allows you to add a new task to an existing orchestration.

**Usage:**
```bash
orchestration add-task --orchestration-id 12345 --task "Data Processing"
```

### Remove Task
The `remove-task` command removes a specified task from an orchestration.

**Usage:**
```bash
orchestration remove-task --orchestration-id 12345 --task-id 67890
```

### List Tasks
The `list-tasks` command lists all tasks associated with a specific orchestration.

**Usage:**
```bash
orchestration list-tasks --orchestration-id 12345
```

## Error Handling
When executing commands, errors may occur. It is important to handle these errors gracefully. The library provides a mechanism to catch and respond to errors.

**Example:**
```bash
orchestration start --name myOrchestration || echo "Failed to start orchestration. Please check the parameters."
```

## Conclusion
This document outlines the essential commands and task management features of the orchestration library. By following the provided examples and guidelines, users can effectively manage their orchestration processes and tasks.
